# chat bot

Welcome to this GitHub repository, a cutting-edge blend of generative AI, web development, and vector databases. This repository houses a Flask-based web application that utilizes the Llama2 model, referred to as LLM, to create an interactive chatbot.

The LLM model is a state-of-the-art generative AI model known for its ability to generate human-like text. In this application, itâ€™s used to answer general questions with high accuracy. The data for the chatbot is loaded into the application, providing a rich source of information for the LLM to draw upon.

The application is built using Flask, a lightweight and versatile web framework for Python. The HTML and CSS code in the application are meticulously crafted, ensuring a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface.

A key feature of this application is the use of Pinecone, a vector database. Vectors from the LLM are loaded into Pinecone, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional data. A pipeline is then used to fetch information from the LLM, ensuring a smooth and efficient flow of data.

In conclusion, this repository showcases the power of combining generative AI, web development, and vector databases. It serves as a valuable resource for those interested in these fields and stands as a testament to the potential of generative AI applications. Explore the repository and experience the power of generative AI!
